## Functional Requirements
Detailed requirements can be found in the pdf document in project [root](Walkers%20Technical%20Assessment%201.0%20-%20Full-Stack%20Developer.pdf).

Got it 👍 — here’s a **lean, recruiter-friendly README snippet in Markdown** that you can copy straight into your `README.md`.

## Features
- Add, update, and manage books  
- Validation on ratings & comments  
- SQLite persistence  
- Unit test coverage  


## Getting Started
### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)  
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
- Git  

## Design

BookHub is structured as a full-stack web application with two main components:

### 1. Frontend – `bookhub-ui`
- **Framework:** Vue 3 with Vite + TypeScript
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Provides a user-friendly UI for interacting with the book collection.
  - Uses **Element Plus** for modern, responsive components.
  - Uses **Vue Router** for navigation and **VueUse** for composable utilities.
  - Displays charts using **Chart.js** + `vue-chartjs`.
- **Key Points:**
  - Communicates with the backend API via **Axios**.
  - Includes unit tests with **Vitest** and **Vue Test Utils**.
  - Built and bundled with **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds.
  
### 2. Backend – `BookHub.App`
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Exposes RESTful endpoints for managing books (CRUD operations).
  - Handles validation logic (e.g., max 25 books, ratings between 1–5, disallowed words in comments).
  - Persists data using **Entity Framework Core** with a SQLite database.
- **Key Points:**
  - All business rules are enforced in the backend to ensure data integrity.
  - Provides JSON responses to the frontend via `axios` calls.
